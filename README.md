<p>An Instagram live simulator with 1:1 replica UI, logistic viewer growth, artificial comments, and more.</p>
<p>Try a live demo out <a href="https://mit.ong/kemino/">here!</a></p>
<p>This is a project inspired by a YouTube video I saw of someone comparing their treatment at parties when they had an Instagram live vs. when they did not. It was obvious through the video that this perceived sense of "fame" led to better treatment (especially at parties.) After some short research, I found that this project had been made before as an iOS application, however, most of the products were made very poorly as a cash grab and required payment for most of the features. Hence, I was inspired to create this project.</p>
<p>⚠️ <strong>As always, I am not liable for any misuse of this simulator  such as using it to deceive or trick others with malicious intent. My software is provided for educational purposes only.</strong></p>
<p>The Live Simulator features a 1:1 replica of the Instagram creator UI. In addition, it boasts the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Logistic viewer growth</li>
<li>Configurable username, profile picture, and viewers</li>
<li>Customizable comments (choose from 9 presets.)</li>
<li>Algorithmically generated usernames & profile pictures for artificial users</li>
<li>Artificial users will interact with your stream</li>
<li>(WIP) AI-Generated comments</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>All of these features are configurable</strong>, so you can enable, disable, and change them to your liking.</p>
<h1 id="setup-guide">Setup Guide</h1>
<h2 id="1-download-the-files">1. Download the files from this repository onto your PC.</h2>
<p>You can download from the &quot;releases&quot; section of this repository.</p>
<h2 id="2-import-the-project-to-your-hosting-provider">2. Import the files to your website host of choice</h2>
<p>If you have RDP or file-access to your website, you can simply upload the file to some directory in your website&#39;s files, e.g. <code>yoursite.com/kemino/</code> You could also host the website locally, but you will need to open a port on your router which I do not recommend unless you know what you are doing.</p>
<h2 id="3-create-the-web-clip">3. Create the web clip</h2>
<p>Use a web-clip creation shortcut such as <a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/d8ca478a6aa848eaacfa7a1634c09113">this one</a> to create a web clip and install it on your iOS device. You will likely need to enter the URL of the website where you host kemino, so please follow all the instructions for your web-clip creation carefully. By creating a web-clip, you have essentially embedded the website as an app on your phone. You can customize the icon, name, and more through the shortcut.</p>
<h2 id="4-configure-and-enjoy">4. Open the app</h2>
<p>Open the app and wait for kemino to download the necessary files. This could take a while, as there are lots of resources that must be loaded. Don't worry though, kemino will cache the required files so that loading is much faster the next time you access the app.</p>
<h2 id="5-all-finished-">5. All finished!</h2>
<p>kemino is set up and ready to use! Now that you are done with setup, you can move on to usage of the application.</p>
<h1 id="usage-guide">Usage Guide</h1>
<h2 id="1-configuring">1. Configuration</h2>
<p>When the app has loaded, you will be greeted with a configuration screen where you can edit your username, profile picture, and viewers. Adjust these as desired and start your live stream.</p>
<h2 id="2-change-comments">2. Change Comments</h2>
<p>Now, your app will be up and running and the stream is active. You will see your viewer count grow to reach the desired value, and artificial users will be interacting with your stream. To adjust the comments of your artificial users, press on one of the nine invisible buttons embedded in the UI. A screenshot guide is shown below for the locations.</p>
